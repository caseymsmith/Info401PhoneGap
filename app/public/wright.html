    Professor Wright is a great teacher that lectures 401 students to make awesome applications! 
    Although in the process of this particular project, a particular student noticed Professor Wright's 
    SU faculty page website link is broken. This student used the website link as the faculty directory 
    webpage as Professor Wright's "website" for this particular page. During the process of creating 
    this scheduling site, the student was also required to add faculty photos. In this process, by attempting
    to click the MyClasses user photo (in this case, Professor Wright's avi was clicked), the student may or
    may not have accidentally reported her professors photo.... oops.
